# Theory - SQL & Databases

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The terms on my list are all commonly used in discussions about relational databases and SQL, with one exception: DQL (Data Query Language). Because DQL is a category with only one statement in it, some people may never learn or say "DQL"; they just say "SELECT." 

In fact, some people include the SELECT statement in the category of DML. I don't use that classification (and I think I'm in the majority), but when you're talking to someone new, be aware that you may need to clear things up with them when they say "DML": Do they mean INSERT-UPDATE-DELETE statements, or do they also include SELECT in the DML category?

There's one more muddy word: query. For most people, the word query is another name for the SELECT statement. This is reasonable, because the English word query is another word for question, and whenever you ask the database a question, you do so by issuing a SELECT statement. But for some people, query can refer to any SQL statement, of any kind at all! This doesn't make good sense to me, but I've heard the words "database query" used in this way many times through the years
