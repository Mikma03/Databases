# What Is Apache Spark, and What Is Spark SQL?

Apache Spark is a large-scale data processing engine. It is capable of running a wide range of different data processing workloads. Apache Spark provides several libraries for performing different kinds of work. One of these libraries is Spark SQL.

Spark SQL is Spark’s library for working with structured data. The name “Spark SQL” seems to suggest that the SQL query language is the central piece of this library, but it is not. Support for the SQL query language is just one part of what Spark SQL provides. Spark SQL also provides programming interfaces for several programming languages (Scala, Java, Python, and R) that are not based on the SQL query language.

# Who Uses Spark SQL?

Spark SQL is most often used by data scientists, data engineers, and big data application developers. Spark SQL helps those types of users work with structured data inside their Spark applications.

# Spark SQL Is Compatible with Hive and Impala.

The good news is that Spark SQL was designed to be highly compatible with Hive and Impala. Spark SQL can query the same tables that Hive and Impala can, and the Spark SQL query syntax is almost entirely compatible with Hive’s query syntax.
